<h3>Dinesh Karthik</h3>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>
Dinesh Karthik is one of the most experienced wicket-keeper batter in the scheme of things. He has led Kolkata Knight Riders to playoffs in 2018 and his side finished fifth in the points table in 2019. Ahead of the 2022 edition of the league, Dinesh Karthik was released by KKR and was available for the IPL Mega Auction. He was bought by RCB for INR 5.5 crore. A veteran campaigner in the IPL, Karthik has been involved in all the editions of the league since the inaugural 2008 season. This will be Karthik's second stint with RCB after the 2015 season, when he was acquired for a whopping Rs 10.5 crore. The wicket-keeper batter has represented six teams over the course of his IPL career. He started off with Delhi Daredevils in 2008 before moving to Kings XI Punjab in 2011. He spent the following two seasons with Mumbai Indians before going back to Delhi in 2014. RCB bagged him in 2015 and he played for Gujarat Lions in 2016 and 2017 before spending four seasons with KKR. An IPL career tally of 4046 runs at a strike rate of 129.72 plus being tidy behind the stumps is testimony to the value he brings to the table.
