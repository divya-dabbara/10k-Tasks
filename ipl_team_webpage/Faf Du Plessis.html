<h3>Faf du Plessis</h3>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>

On March 12, 2022 the former RCB Skipper, Virat Kohli announced that he would be passing on the baton tow Faf du Plessis, who will be the new Captain for the RCB. It will be an all new setup, change in team colours for Faf du Plessis who will be representing the RCB the 2022 edition of the league. The veteran batter from South Africa was bought by the RCB for INR 7 crore at the IPL 2022 Mega Auction. Faf du Plessis started his IPL journey with the CSK and has played for them ever since. The right-handed batter played an all-important knock in the Finals of the 2021 edition of the league, scoring 86 runs off 59 deliveries, thereby winning the Player of the Match for the same. In 2018, Punjab Kings bought Faf for INR 1.6cr, but but CSK trumped them by using their RTM card and it sure was a bargain for them. While the classy and composed batsman did not get many outings in the RPS squad where he was picked up in the IPL player draft, du Plessis had consistent performances for CSK wherein he went on to have a very successful debut season scoring 398 runs. He impressed with a half-century on his ODI debut, against India and soon enough, found himself in South Africaâ€™s squad for the 2011 World Cup. With a century on Test debut against Australia, du Plessis has shed the tag of a limited-overs specialist. Although batting remains his area of prowess, du Plessis can come up with a few handy leg-spinners when required. To boot that, he is a livewire in the field, hence, making him a perfect T20 package for any captain.
