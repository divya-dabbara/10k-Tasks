<h3>Anuj Rawat</h3>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>
Born in Uttarakhand, uncapped wicket-keeper batter, Anuj Rawat was picked for INR 3.4 crore by RCB on Day 1 of the IPL 2022 Mega Auction. The left-handed batter made his First-Class debut for Delhi versus Assam. Batting at No 7, Rawat scored 71 off 147 balls with seven fours and one six in that match. The 22-year-old slammed 925 runs from 19 First-Class games at an average of 34.25 including two centuries and three half-centuries. Young Anuj is an investment for the RCB as he possesses great skills with the bat and can act as a finisher too. Earlier in 2021, Anuj Rawat was bought by the Rajasthan Royals.
